# E-Commerce-Website-django
This is a simple e-commerce website using Django allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and make purchases. The website includes:

1. Product Listings: Show available products with images, descriptions, and prices.
2. Product Details: Provide more information about each product.
3. Shopping Cart: Lets users view and manage items they want to buy.
4. Checkout: Collects shipping and payment details to complete the purchase.
5. Order Confirmation: Displays a summary of the order after purchase.

The site is built with Django's models to manage product data, user accounts, and orders, while views and templates handle the user interface. Static files are used for styling, and media files manage product images. The Django admin interface allows for easy management of products and orders.
